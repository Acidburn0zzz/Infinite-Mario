A copy of the code for "Infinite Mario Brothers".
Originally written by Markus "Notch" Persson (a.k.a the Minecraft guy).
Converted from Java to AS3 by a Japanese programmer known (AFAIK) as "Fashrod"

Copyright:

Images and sounds are copyright Nintendo. You should replace them with original content!

Code originally by Notch, and released into the public domain (see doc/LICENSE.txt)
Flash conversion, apparently, also released into the public domain. (see doc/README_ja_JP_utf8.txt)
I don't speak Japanese, but I believe he said his code is "under the same license" (Either that, or he called my mother a whore)

I have uploaded it to make a few tweaks:

	- Levels don't change when you re-enter them
	- Working score
	- Spinies die from fire
	- More 1-Ups
	- Less Bullet Bills, more pits
	

My contributions are also released back into the public domain.
